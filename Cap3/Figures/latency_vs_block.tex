\caption[Latency vs Block size]{Latency vs Block size. 
In the left is possible to see that the latency is proportional to the block size. 
In the right plot, the latency decrease for small block size but their standard deviation (jitter) increase. 
The preferred configuration was set up in 100 samples block size due the lower jitter.}
