A very special thanks goes out to my parents who always believed in the power of education.\\

I would like to express my gratitude to the professors Andrés Marino Álvarez Meza and Germán Castellanos Domínguez for their orientation during this research. Besides, I would like to thank all the Signal Processing and Recognition Group (SPRG) of the Universidad Nacional de Colombia sede Manizales for their suggestions and hours of academic discussion, to David Cardenas Peña and the Automatic research group of the Universidad Tecnológica de Pereira for allow me to work in so interesting projects. Finally, special tanks to Vanessa Cañaveral for her revisions and corrections about the redaction of this document.

Finally, I recognize that this research would not have been possible without the support given by the project: \textit{Caracterización Morfológica de Estructuras Cerebrales por Técnicas de Imagen para el Tratamiento Mediante Implantación Quirúrgica de Neuroestimuladores en la Enfermedad de Parkinson  (código 110180763808)}, funded by MINCIENCIAS.
